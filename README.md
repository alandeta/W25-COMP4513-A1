### Assignment 1: Node API | Alyssa Landeta | February 24, 2025
## Overview
This repository contains code for an API that provides access to information about artists, galleries, and paintings from a database. The API is built using Node.js (JS runtime) and Express (routing), with data stored in a Supabase database. It allows users to query various endpoints to retrieve details such as:
* Artists: Information about artists, including names, countries, and more.
* Galleries: Data about art galleries and exhibitions.
* Paintings: Information about individual paintings, including titles, years, and associated artists.

The data is returned in JSON format. The API includes multiple routes that allow filtering and sorting of data based on specific criteria such as country, year of creation, artist, and more.It also provides error handling for cases such as missing data or invalid parameters. The application uses a RESTful architecture and provides error messages for incorrectly formatted requests or missing data.
